## Installation

You have to use either `yarn` or `npm` to get the latest version of `create-r3f-app`

If you are using `yarn`:

```bash
yarn create r3f-app <stack> <project-name> <style-library>
```

If you are using `npm`:

```bash
npx create-r3f-app <stack> <project-name> <style-library>
```

**We don't recommend anymore installing `create-r3f-app` globally but rather using `npx`/`yarn create`.**
